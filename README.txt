JAVA 8 project using spring boot 

please check:
- Cousine
    - Segregated services so is easy to maintain e scale.
    - Has a Command for Business Logic and code decoupling.
    - Used DTO to return models 
- Authentication
    - Tried to implement / use JWT max as I could. Used from another spring base repo.

The others should fallow Cousine model. So I haven't worked in them. 

Also, I've attached an architecture that I was thinking before the test.
